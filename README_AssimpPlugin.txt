OTHER COMMENTS :

Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp) is a portable Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner. 
The most recent version also knows how to export 3D files and is therefore suitable as a general-purpose 3D model converter. 
See the feature list.

Important: For the moment only single Mesh is handle. That is to say, if a multi mesh is loaded, only one Sofa Mesh will be created by merging all sub meshes.
